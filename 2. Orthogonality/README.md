run the hadronic $\tau$ and leptonic channels code using `FCCAnalyses run code.py`  and then feed it to the optimization code.
the optimization code only needs the output files to be available in the `PWD`.
Be careful not to mess up the hadronic and leptonic taus since they have the same file name.
